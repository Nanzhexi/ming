abstract: This study develops a spatial interaction model to simulate urban spatial structure under different scenarios, with a particular focus on urban polycentricity. We examine how different policy interventions and development scenarios affect the emergence and evolution of polycentric urban forms. The model provides insights into the complex relationships between spatial interactions and urban structure formation, offering valuable tools for urban planning and policy analysis.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
