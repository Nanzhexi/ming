abstract: This study examines the relationship between bike-sharing systems and urban traffic congestion using evidence from multiple US cities. We analyze how the introduction and expansion of bike-sharing programs affect traffic patterns and congestion levels. The research provides insights into the potential of bike-sharing as a sustainable transportation solution for reducing urban congestion and improving mobility.
