abstract: This study measures polycentric urban development using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR imagery in Shanghai, China. We develop innovative methods for analyzing urban structure evolution using satellite radar data, providing insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of polycentric development. The research demonstrates the potential of SAR imagery for monitoring urban growth and polycentricity in rapidly developing cities.
