abstract: "This study presents a novel multimodal learning approach for occupation prediction by integrating Tweet messages and Google Street View images. We develop a deep learning framework that combines natural language processing of social media text with computer vision analysis of urban imagery to predict occupational patterns in different neighborhoods. The research demonstrates the potential of combining diverse data sources for understanding socio-economic characteristics of urban areas."
