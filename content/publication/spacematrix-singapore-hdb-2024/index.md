abstract: "This research employs spacematrix and clustering approaches to understand the morphology of Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB) estates. We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that combines spatial metrics with clustering algorithms to classify and characterize different types of HDB developments. The study reveals distinct morphological patterns and provides insights into the evolution of public housing design in Singapore, contributing to better understanding of high-density urban development strategies."
