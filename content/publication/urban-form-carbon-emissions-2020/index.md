abstract: This study examines the relationships between urban form, shrinking cities, and residential carbon emissions using evidence from Chinese city-regions. We analyze how different urban morphologies and demographic changes affect residential energy consumption and carbon emissions. The research provides insights into sustainable urban development strategies and climate change mitigation through urban planning.
