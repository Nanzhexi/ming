abstract: This study conducts a two-level comparison of CO2 emission data in China using evidence from three gridded data sources. We evaluate the consistency and reliability of different emission datasets, providing insights into data quality and methodological differences in carbon emission estimation. The research contributes to improving carbon accounting and climate change research.
