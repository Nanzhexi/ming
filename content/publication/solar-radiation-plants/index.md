abstract: This study investigates how solar radiation influences plant species distribution in urban built-up areas. Through comprehensive field surveys and remote sensing analysis, we examine the relationship between solar exposure patterns and vegetation diversity in urban environments. The findings provide insights for urban green space planning and biodiversity conservation in cities.
