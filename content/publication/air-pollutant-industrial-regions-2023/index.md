abstract: This study elucidates spatial disparities of factors affecting air pollutant concentrations in industrial regions at a continental level. We analyze the complex relationships between industrial activities, environmental factors, and air quality across different spatial scales. The research provides insights into air pollution patterns and their driving factors in industrial contexts, informing environmental management and policy decisions.
