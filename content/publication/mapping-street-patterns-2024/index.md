abstract: "This research develops innovative approaches for mapping street patterns using network science and supervised machine learning techniques. We propose a comprehensive framework that combines graph theory with machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and classify different types of street network patterns in urban environments. The methodology demonstrates high accuracy in pattern recognition and provides valuable insights for urban planning and design applications."
