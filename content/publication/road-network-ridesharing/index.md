abstract: This study applies network science principles to examine the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. We analyze how different network topological characteristics affect the efficiency and accessibility of ride-sharing services. The research provides insights into how urban infrastructure design can be optimized to support emerging mobility services and improve transportation equity.
