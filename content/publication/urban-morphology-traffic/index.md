abstract: This study provides longitudinal evidence of the relationship between urban morphology and traffic congestion across US cities. Using comprehensive datasets spanning multiple years, we analyze how different urban form characteristics influence traffic flow patterns and congestion levels. The research offers insights for sustainable urban planning and transportation policy.
