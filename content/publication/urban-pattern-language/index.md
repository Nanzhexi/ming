abstract: This research formalises the urban pattern language concept through a morphological paradigm that enables systematic understanding of multi-scalar spatial structures in cities. We develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing urban patterns across different scales, from building blocks to city-wide structures, providing new insights into urban form and function relationships.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
