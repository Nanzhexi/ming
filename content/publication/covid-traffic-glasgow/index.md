abstract: This study examines how urban traffic flows in Glasgow responded to the COVID-19 pandemic using emerging urban big data sources. We analyze temporal and spatial variations in traffic patterns during different phases of the pandemic, revealing significant changes in mobility behaviors and their implications for urban transportation planning. The research provides insights into urban resilience and adaptive capacity during crisis situations.
