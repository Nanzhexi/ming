abstract: This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between urban expansion and the urban-rural income gap in China. We analyze how spatial patterns of urban growth influence income disparities between urban and rural areas, examining the mechanisms through which urban expansion affects economic opportunities and income distribution. The research offers important insights for understanding the socioeconomic consequences of rapid urbanization.
