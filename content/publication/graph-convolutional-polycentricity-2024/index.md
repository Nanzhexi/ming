abstract: "This research applies graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to street network analysis with a specific focus on urban polycentricity in Chinese cities. We develop a novel GCN-based framework that can effectively capture the complex spatial relationships in street networks and identify polycentric structures. The methodology is validated using data from multiple Chinese cities, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional network analysis methods in detecting urban centers and understanding urban spatial structure."
