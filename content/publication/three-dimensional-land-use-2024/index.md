abstract: "This study examines three-dimensional land-use configuration and its relationship with property prices using a spatially filtered multi-level modelling perspective. We develop an innovative analytical framework that incorporates vertical urban development patterns and their spatial dependencies in property valuation models. The research demonstrates how 3D urban morphology significantly influences real estate markets and provides new insights for urban planning and property development strategies in high-density cities."
