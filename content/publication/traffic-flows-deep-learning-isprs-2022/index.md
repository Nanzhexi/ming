abstract: This study analyzes the influencing factors of urban traffic flows using new and emerging urban big data and deep learning techniques. We develop advanced analytical methods to understand complex traffic patterns and their underlying drivers in urban environments. The research demonstrates the potential of combining big data analytics with deep learning for traffic flow analysis and urban transportation planning.
