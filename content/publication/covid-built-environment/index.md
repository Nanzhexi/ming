abstract: This study examines the relationship between built environment characteristics and early COVID-19 infection patterns in urban districts, using Huangzhou as a case study. We analyze how various urban design features, density patterns, and infrastructure elements influenced the spatial distribution of early COVID-19 cases. The findings provide important insights for urban planning and public health policy in the context of pandemic preparedness and response.
