abstract: This study develops a spatial optimization approach to improve equitable access to urban agriculture opportunities in Glasgow. Using geospatial analysis and optimization algorithms, we identify optimal locations for new urban agriculture sites that maximize accessibility while considering existing infrastructure and community needs. The research provides practical guidance for urban food system planning.
