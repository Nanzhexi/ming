abstract: This study presents a hierarchical spatial unit partitioning approach for fine-grained urban functional region identification. We develop innovative methods for decomposing urban areas into meaningful functional units at multiple scales, enabling more precise analysis of urban structure and function. The approach provides a framework for understanding complex urban systems and supporting urban planning decisions.
