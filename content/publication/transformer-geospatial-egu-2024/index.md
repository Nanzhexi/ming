abstract: "This research presents a Transformer-based model for effective representation of geospatial data and context. We develop a novel deep learning architecture that leverages the attention mechanism of Transformers to capture complex spatial relationships and contextual information in geographic data. The model demonstrates superior performance in various geospatial analysis tasks and provides a new paradigm for processing and understanding spatial information using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques."
