abstract: This paper addresses a critical methodological issue in measuring polycentric urban development - the accurate determination of 'balance' between urban centers. We propose improved methods for quantifying polycentricity that better capture the complex relationships between multiple urban centers. Our approach provides more nuanced measurements of urban structure that can inform planning decisions and policy interventions in polycentric urban regions.
