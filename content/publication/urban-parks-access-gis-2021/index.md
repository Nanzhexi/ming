abstract: This study compares spatial accessibility measures for urban parks using three different GIS-based approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of various accessibility metrics in capturing park access patterns and examine how different methodological choices affect accessibility assessments. The research provides insights into best practices for measuring urban green space accessibility and supports evidence-based urban planning decisions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
