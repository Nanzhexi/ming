abstract: This study develops machine learning approaches for characterizing urban morphology through street pattern analysis. We propose novel methods to extract and quantify street network characteristics, using these features to classify and understand different urban morphological types. The research demonstrates the potential of automated approaches for large-scale urban form analysis.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
