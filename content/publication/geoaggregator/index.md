abstract: This paper presents GeoAggregator, an efficient Transformer model specifically designed for geo-spatial tabular data. The model addresses unique challenges in processing spatial data by incorporating geographic relationships and spatial dependencies. We demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods on various geo-spatial prediction tasks, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency.
