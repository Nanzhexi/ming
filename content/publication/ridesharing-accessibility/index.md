abstract: This research examines ridesharing accessibility through the lens of human visual perception using street-level imagery. We develop spatial models that incorporate built environment characteristics as perceived by humans, analyzing how visual elements of the urban landscape influence ridesharing service accessibility. The study bridges computer vision, urban analytics, and transportation research.
