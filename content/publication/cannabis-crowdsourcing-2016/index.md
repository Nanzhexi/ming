abstract: This study examines the use of crowdsourcing to map the landscape of cannabis (marijuana) across the contiguous United States. We explore how crowdsourced data can be used to understand the spatial distribution and patterns of cannabis-related activities, providing insights into the geography of cannabis in the US. The research demonstrates innovative applications of crowdsourcing in geographic research.
