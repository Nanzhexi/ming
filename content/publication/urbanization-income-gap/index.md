abstract: This study conducts a comprehensive meta-regression analysis to examine the effects of urbanization on the urban-rural income gap in China. By synthesizing findings from multiple studies, we provide a systematic assessment of how different aspects of urbanization influence income disparities between urban and rural areas. The analysis reveals complex relationships that vary across regions and time periods, offering important insights for policy makers addressing inequality in rapidly urbanizing contexts.
