abstract: This study examines taxi ridership patterns by analyzing spatial spillover effects and temporal dynamics. We develop comprehensive models to understand how taxi demand varies across space and time, considering the interconnected nature of urban mobility. The research provides insights into the complex dynamics of urban transportation systems and their spatial-temporal characteristics.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
