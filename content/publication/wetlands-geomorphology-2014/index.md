abstract: This study examines what geomorphological characteristics accommodate emergent herbaceous wetlands in North Georgia through geographic knowledge discovery from NLCD and DEM data. We analyze the topographic and landscape factors that influence wetland distribution and characteristics, providing insights into wetland ecology and landscape relationships. The research contributes to understanding wetland-landscape interactions.
