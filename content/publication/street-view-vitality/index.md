abstract: This research explores neighbourhood organisational vitality through street view imagery and big data analytics. We develop methods to extract and analyze visual indicators of community life and social activity from street-level photographs, revealing patterns of neighbourhood vitality that are not captured by traditional urban indicators. The study demonstrates the potential of computer vision for urban social research.
