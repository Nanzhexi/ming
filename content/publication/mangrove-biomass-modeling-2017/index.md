abstract: This study models projected changes of mangrove biomass under different climatic scenarios in the Sunda Banda Seascapes. We analyze how climate change may affect mangrove ecosystems and their biomass distribution, providing insights for conservation planning and ecosystem management. The research contributes to understanding climate impacts on coastal ecosystems.
