## About Me

Maria Garcia is an MPhil student in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working in the Mobility Science Lab under the supervision of Dr. Mingshu Wang. Her research focuses on promoting active transportation and sustainable mobility in urban environments.

Maria's thesis investigates the relationship between cycling infrastructure design and usage patterns in Hong Kong, using GPS tracking data and computer vision techniques to analyze cyclist behavior and safety. She is particularly interested in how urban design elements can encourage more people to adopt cycling as a daily transportation mode.

Originally from Madrid, Spain, Maria brings a European perspective on sustainable transportation planning to her research. Before starting her MPhil, she worked as a junior engineer at a transportation consulting firm in Madrid, where she gained hands-on experience in traffic analysis and infrastructure design.

Maria is passionate about creating more livable and sustainable cities through better transportation planning. She actively participates in local cycling advocacy groups and volunteers for community outreach programs promoting active transportation.
