## About Me

I am a PhD researcher in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow, working under the supervision of Dr. Mingshu Wang. My research focuses on applying advanced geospatial data science techniques to understand urban dynamics and spatial patterns.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:
- **Geospatial Data Science**: Developing novel methods for analyzing large-scale spatial datasets
- **Urban Analytics**: Understanding urban patterns and processes through data-driven approaches
- **Machine Learning**: Applying ML techniques to geographical and urban problems
- **Remote Sensing**: Using satellite imagery for urban monitoring and analysis

## Current Research

I am currently working on projects related to urban spatial analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to geospatial data. My work contributes to understanding how cities evolve and function in the context of rapid urbanization.
