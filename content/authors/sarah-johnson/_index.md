## About Me

Dr. Sarah Johnson is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Mobility Science Lab, specializing in the intersection of urban mobility, environmental health, and social equity. She joined the lab in 2023 after completing her PhD in Geography at UC Berkeley.

Sarah's research examines how transportation systems and urban mobility patterns affect environmental justice and public health outcomes in different communities. She is particularly interested in using geospatial AI and machine learning techniques to identify and address mobility-related health disparities in urban areas.

Her current projects include analyzing the relationship between transportation accessibility and health outcomes in Hong Kong, and developing community-based participatory mapping tools to understand mobility barriers faced by vulnerable populations. Sarah has published extensively in top-tier journals and has received several awards for her innovative research methods and community engagement work.
