## About Me

Xinyi Yuan is a PhD researcher in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow, working under the supervision of Dr. Mingshu Wang. Her research focuses on urban geography and spatial analysis, with particular interest in understanding urban development patterns and their implications for sustainable city planning.

With a strong background in geography and urban planning, Xinyi brings a multidisciplinary approach to her research. She completed her MSc in Urban Planning at University College London, where she developed expertise in urban development theories and planning methodologies. Her undergraduate studies in Geography at Nanjing University provided her with a solid foundation in spatial analysis and geographic information systems.

Xinyi's current research centers on the application of GIS and spatial analysis techniques to understand urban phenomena. She is particularly interested in how urban spatial structures influence social interactions and economic activities, contributing to the broader understanding of urban systems and their sustainability.
