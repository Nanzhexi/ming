## About Me

Zhang Wei is a PhD student in the Mobility Science Lab at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working under the supervision of Dr. Mingshu Wang. His research focuses on understanding urban mobility patterns using big data analytics and machine learning techniques.

Wei's current research investigates how different urban forms and transportation infrastructure influence human mobility behaviors in megacities. He is particularly interested in developing predictive models for transportation demand and optimizing urban planning strategies using AI-driven approaches.

Before joining the PhD program, Wei worked as a GIS analyst at a urban planning consultancy in Beijing, where he gained practical experience in applying spatial analysis techniques to real-world urban development projects.
