## About Me

I am a PhD researcher in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow, working under the supervision of Dr. Mingshu Wang. My research focuses on remote sensing applications in environmental geography and climate change studies.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:
- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite and aerial imagery analysis for environmental monitoring
- **Environmental Geography**: Understanding human-environment interactions
- **Climate Change**: Impacts and adaptation strategies in urban environments
- **Satellite Image Analysis**: Advanced techniques for processing satellite data

## Current Research

I am currently investigating the use of remote sensing technologies for monitoring environmental changes in urban areas. My work focuses on developing methods to assess climate change impacts and support environmental decision-making through satellite data analysis.
